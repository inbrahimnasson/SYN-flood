SYN flood written C++ using Boost.Asio
raw_tcp.hpp: Add a protocol to access raw TCP
tcp_header.hpp: Define TCP header class

This program is using socket(AF_INET,SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_TCP)
    to create raw socket.
This is incomplete because the reason below.
[*] After sending TCP SYN packet the Linux Kernel 
    will send TCP RST packet(against my own will !!) and then, TCP 3 way handshake will be refused.
To solve this problem, I think, 
   using a socket(2) system call with IPPROTO_IP is the best way.
But it's not implemented yet.
