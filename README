SYN flood written in C++ using Boost.Asio
raw_tcp.hpp      : Add a protocol to access raw TCP for Asio
tcp_header.hpp   : Define a TCP header class

This is incomplete because the reason below.
[*] After sending TCP SYN packet the Linux Kernel will send 
      TCP RST packet(against our own will !!) and then, TCP 3 way handshake will be refused.
Enabling IPHDRINC is the best way to solve this problem.
IPHDRINCL is a socket option to access the layer 3 for raw socket
Also we are able to forge the source IP address. And all the requirements for SYN flood will be met. 
But it's not implemented yet.
